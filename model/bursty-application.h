 * \brief Generate traffic to a single destination in bursty fashion.
 *
 * This traffic generator supports large packets to be sent into smaller
 * packet (fragment) bursts.
 * The fragment size can be chosen arbitrarily, although it usually set
 * to match the MTU of the chosen network.
 * The burst size and period are controlled by a class extending the
 * BurstGenerator interface.
 * 
 * This application assumes to operate on top of a UDP socket, sending
 * data to a BurstSink.
 * These two classes coexist, one fragmenting a large packet into a burst
 * of smaller fragments, the other by re-assembling the fragments into
 * the full packet.
 * 
 * Fragments have all the same length, which can be set via its attribute.
 * The last two segments of the burst might be shorter: the last one
 * because it represents the remainder of the burst size with respect to
 * the maximum frame size, the second to last because packets cannot be
 * smaller that the SeqTsSizeFragHeader size. If the last fragment is
 * too short, the second to last fragment is shortened in order to
 * increase the size of the last fragment.
 * Also, if a BurstGenerator generates a burst of size less than the
 * SeqTsSizeFragHeader size, the burst is discarded and a new burst is
 * queried to the generator.
