 * \brief Virtual interface for burst generators.
 *
 * A virtual interface defining the API for burst generators.
 * Burst generators are thought to be used by BurstyApplication,
 * although their interface might be re-used by other applications.
 * 
 * The interface defines two purely virtual methods:
 * - GenerateBurst: generates a new burst, returning its total burst
 * size and the time before the next burst
 * - HasNextBurst: to check whether GenerateBurst can be safely called.
 * 
 * The interface is meant to allow for great flexibility in its child
 * classes: such classes can include complex behavior, such as arbitrary
 * probability distributions for burst size and period, correlations
 * among successive burst sizes and periods, cross-correlation between
 * burst size and period, etc.
